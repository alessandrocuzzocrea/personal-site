## Introduction

{{< image src="pixar-exhibition-intro.jpg" alt="alt placeholder" >}}

The **Pixar** exhibition I waited for has finally arrived in Japan! As a Pixar fan and 3D graphic enthusiast, I have waited for this exhibition since it was first announced in the US and now I finally got the opportunity to experience it firsthand.  
The exhibition was held in the **Tokyo City View Observation Deck** located at the top of the **Mori Tower** in **Roppongi Hills**. The Observation Deck is a beautiful structure with a high ceiling and glass walls that extend all the way around the building, giving visitors views of the entire city. The Observation Deck is located on the 52nd floor of the Mori Tower (250 meters above sea level).  
I met up with a bunch of friends on a hot Saturday afternoon at Roppongi hills near the giant spider sculpture and then we ventured inside the tower. It was my first time climbing it. 
The ticket was 1,500 yen for the early bird price and 1,800 yen for the regular one.  
The Pixar Exhibition Japanese name is **Pixar no Himitsu-ten - Inochi o Umidasu Science** which roughly translates to Pixar’s Secret exhibition - The science that creates life.  
Also please excuse me for the quality of the pictures accompanying this post. My phone camera didn’t do any justice to this wonderful exhibition.  

## Pixar’s Production Pipeline

{{< image src="pixar-exhibition-production-pipeline.jpg" alt="alt placeholder" >}}

Upon entering the exhibition floor, we were presented with a series of panels explaining in detail the production pipeline starting from the storyboard & concept art and finishing with the final render pass.

## Story & Art

{{< image src="pixar-exhibition-story-and-art.jpg" alt="alt placeholder" >}}

This is the first and fundamental phase in which every Pixar movie starts production.
Writers start writing the **story** that will eventually become the backbone of the whole movie.  

The **scenario**, also known as **movie script**, is a written document detailing the structure, action, and dialogues of the movie.  

A **storyboard** is also created in the process. A storyboard is like a blueprint for the movie.
Creating a storyboard is like creating a rough sketch before starting a painting. It helps visualize, explore, and plan the work ahead. A storyboard usually contains sketches but it may also contain reference images or other kinds of information like the textual description of the scene. A storyboard complements the scenario and helps add a visual dimension to it.

**Concept art** instead is a collection of drawings used to capture the essence and vision of a movie. It’s commonly used to have a quick visual representation of the movie before committing to it any further. The purpose of concept art is not to produce high-quality artworks but instead to quickly explore ideas for the movie. Concept art helps visualize the look and feel of the movie providing a strong reference point to help the other artists working on the movie.

**Clay sculptures** are also created to visualize the design. Creating real sculpture is a way to check if the design created with a two-dimensional drawing still works when transferred to a tri-dimensional world. This is better done with objects in the real world since sometimes the 3d perspective displayed by 3d software may be deceptive to the eyes (since the software had to display the image on a 2d screen).  
With real sculptures there is no cheating.

## Modeling

{{< image src="pixar-exhibition-modeling.jpg" alt="alt placeholder" >}}

The next step is **modeling**, which is the process of turning a character or an object into a 3d model using dedicated computer software.  
A 3d model is basically a collection of vertices, edges and faces used to describe the surface of the object.  
The resulting 3D model will be more or less detailed depending on the complexity of the subject we are modeling.  
Since character models are so important, modelers need to take special care when creating them.
For example, the 3D model for Joy (in the pic) required 17 passes and revisions before it was considered finally completed.

## Rigging

{{< image src="pixar-exhibition-rigging.jpg" alt="alt placeholder" >}}

**Rigging** is the process of creating virtual joins and virtual muscles so the animators can design the character's movements.
The rig reproduces how the joins bend, and the skin stretches around the joins.
Think of the rig like the skeleton for the 3d model. You move the skeleton and the model moves with it.

## Surfaces

{{< image src="pixar-exhibition-surfaces.jpg" alt="alt placeholder" >}}

Surface artists create **surface shaders**, computer programs used to give the 3d model’s surfaces their rendered look.  
For example, shaders are used to make the surface appear opaque, reflective, translucent, smooth, rough, etc.  
Surface details like a character skin, hair, clothes colors, and patterns, textures are also reproduced using shaders.  

## Set & Camera

{{< image src="pixar-exhibition-sets-and-cameras.jpg" alt="alt placeholder" >}}

**Virtual sets** are the environments where the movie story will unfold.  
Virtual sets are created by set designers just like architects would design a physical environment.  
Every element in the set is either modeled by hand (like you would model a character) or procedurally generated using specialized software.  
Virtual cameras are just like real cameras, and camera artists determine the best combinations of light, perspective, lens, movement, and composition to enrich the story.  
Rough camera movements and camera angles are finalized in this step.  

## Animation

{{< image src="pixar-exhibition-animation.jpg" alt="alt placeholder" >}}

**Animation** breathes life into the movie.  
Our characters would be lifeless without animations.  
Animations are divided into a sequence of poses called keyframes.  
The animators animate the 3d model using the rig created in the previous step of the pipeline, posing the characters to perform their virtual acting.  
Animators set the poses for the keyframes and the animation software will help with the interpolation calculating how the object should move in between keyframes.  

## Simulation

{{< image src="pixar-exhibition-simulation.jpg" alt="alt placeholder" >}}

Some animations and effects are too hard or time-consuming to be authored by hand.  
This is the perfect use case for **simulation**. We can just let the computer do the hard work for us.  
Using complex algorithms is it possible to calculate realistically how particles and other effects like water, fire, smoke, hair, cloth movements would interact with the character movements and the environment.  
Simulations with a higher degree of realism require a higher computation time.  

## Lighting

{{< image src="pixar-exhibition-lighting.jpg" alt="alt placeholder" >}}

**Lighting** is crucial for setting the mood of the shoot.  
Lighting designers carefully craft virtual lights inside a virtual set to help bring the scene to life. Different lighting setups can drastically change the mood of the scene.  
The lighting setup is the sum of all the lights affecting the scene.  
Since the calculations needed for such lights can be really computationally expensive, the light rendering quality used while working on a scene is a fast approximation. The final render will use a higher quality setting.  

## Rendering

{{< image src="pixar-exhibition-rendering.jpg" alt="alt placeholder" >}}

**Rendering** is the process of creating a 2D image using all the data we prepared in the previous steps. The resulting image is the sum of all the previous activities in the pipeline.  
During the rendering process, the computer calculates the color of every single pixel composing the final image.  
Model geometry, model count, surfaces, lighting, simulations, quality settings, image resolution, frame count, etc, are all factors that influence the rendering time. The higher the complexity, the longer the rendering time will be. For example, that frame of Joy waving at the train took 33 hours to fully render.  

## Conclusions

I really enjoyed this exhibition. It really makes you appreciate how much hours and care Pixar puts into every single movie they produce. I really like 3D animation cause it’s the perfect intersection between art and science.  
I wish I could have gone back there on a less crowded day to explore more every single interactive exhibit.
