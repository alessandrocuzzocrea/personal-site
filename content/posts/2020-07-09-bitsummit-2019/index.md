The first time I’ve heard about BitSummit was a few years ago while I was watching the Branching Paths (an excellent documentary about Japan’s indie game scene). Initially founded by James Mielke, an ex-game journalist turned game developer, the BitSummit it’s all about giving a voice to the myriad of small indie game developers from Japan and beyond. 

This year the 7th BitSummit, officially called BitSummit 7 Spirits, was held in Kyoto (1-2nd of June).

February, while I was attending the monthly indie dev gathering “Tokyo Indies”, I got to know two BitSummit organizers and they invited me to take part at this year BitSummit as a volunteer. I promptly accepted as I thought this will be an awesome chance to network with other indie devs from all over the world! We exchanged our contact information, and they said they’ll let me know the details.

After a few months, I got invited to the BitSummit Volunteers Facebook group where the volunteers organized the preparations.

The event weekend came along quickly. Me, and two friends of mine, who volunteered for this year BitSummit, boarded the Shinkansen on Friday after work to reach Kyoto.

Day 1

After a pleasant 2 hours Shinkansen trip, we finally reached Kyoto. We quickly checked-in in our respective hotels and we went to the pre-event party hosted by the volunteering leaders. It was an awesome night. I got to meet a bunch of interesting people from the most diverse backgrounds and cultures. Lots of native English speakers working teaching or translation jobs, but also lots of game industry professionals living and working in the Kansai area. 

Saturday morning I woke up early, had a quick convenience store breakfast, and I took a bus for the Miyako Messe, the convention center where the BitSummit is held.

The event is being held on the 3rd floor of the Miyako Messe. The convention center is really nice and modern and can be reached with ease with a short 20 minutes train trip from Kyoto station.  

At 9:00 the volunteer meeting starts. Around 80 volunteers gathered in the lobby. 

The volunteer team leaders welcome us and give us a brief explanation regarding what we are supposed to do. We also got swag like our official volunteer t-shirts and staff badges. Then We get assigned to our subgroup and get further instructions from our subgroup leader.
After that, we finally moved to the exhibition floor.

One hour left before we open the gates for the press and general public to come in and enjoy the show. Devs are still putting the finishing touches on their boots and demo machines. Excitement is in the air. Our team leader gave us the exhibition floor tour, and we decided on our shift and schedule.

10 minutes before the opening. Organizations are giving the opening speech in the central stage. After that we took the group photos. Finally, the gates open and visitors flood in.

The first shift I was assigned to Japanese Game Journalists who would interview a few international devs. It was the first time I had to do real-time English-Japanese interpretation in a professional context. It turned out to be a great personal challenge and learning experience. 

Volunteers were free to explore the exhibition floor and try out the games when they were not busy helping out.

Around 13:00 my group had the lunch break. The event organizers kindly offered the meal, which consisted of your typical Japanese lunch box (one could choose between meat or fish). A variety of soft drinks were also available to all the volunteers free of charge. We chilled for around 20 minutes and then headed back to the floor.

During the second half, they assigned me to the photo booth, a little and quiet space where we took pictures of the visitors and provided them with a download link so they would remember the fun times they had at the BitSummit. Everything went well. Working at the photo booth ended up being great fun. Visitors loved taking silly pictures with us!

The other volunteers and I were enjoying our time there at the photo booth when we noticed an unusual number of people talking and saying goodbye to each other in front of the IGN Japan booth. It looks like they just concluded their interview. And there he was. Hideki Kamiya. He was unmistakable with his glasses with orange spectacles. Kamiya is a former Capcom employee now working at PlatinumGames, which he co-founded with other former Capcom staff. We couldn’t pass the opportunity to take a photo with Kamiya so I politely asked him if he wanted to take a picture with us and he agreed.

After taking the pic and giving the card with the download link to Kamiya, we chatted about random stuff. When I mentioned that I’m interested in developing my own games he was really cool with it and he started telling me some anecdotes of when he was starting out. Really inspiring stuff.

After we finish talking I salute Kamiya leaving with the promise that we’ll meet again someday. Since my shift at the photo booth was over, I just started wandering around the exhibition floor looking for somebody in need of help while trying out games and talking to developers. 

It’s 17:00, time to wrap it up for today. I exit the Kyoto Messe and I head for the Kamogawa River. The location is a popular gathering spot for Kyoto residents and tourists.

BitSummit staff, volunteers, and developers got together to celebrate the successful outcome of the first day of the BitSummit. The party was another wonderful opportunity to network with some of the most brilliant people in the Japanese video game community. But tomorrow it will be another busy day for most of us and I have to get ready for day 2, so around 22:00 I leave the party and I walk toward my hotel.

As I was reaching my hotel, I made a slight detour to visit Nintendo’s historic former headquarters.

Day 2

It’s already Sunday and I wake up at 8:00. I take a quick bath, I get dressed and start walking toward the nearest bus stop. I arrived at the Kyoto Messe just in time for the volunteers’ morning meeting.

The second day started exactly like the first one, with a brief explanation and the opening ceremony.

The biggest highlight of day 2 was meeting Swery. Hidetaka Suehiro (best known in the industry by the moniker Swery65) was presenting his new game, The Missing: J.J. Macfield and the Island of Memories, to a foreign journalist. Swery English is amazing. He didn’t need my help at all, so instead, I just listened to his explanation. After the journalist was done with the interview, I seized the opportunity and started chatting with him. He was super nice, he started explaining to me how he got the idea for the game and part of his creative process. His company, White Owls Inc, was also presenting another game, The Good Life, at the Microsoft booth, and he suggested going there and try it if I had any free time. We exchanged business cards and we left with the promise to meet again in Tokyo someday to have an extended chat.

The second day at BitSummit went smoothly without problems. I got the impression that we had even more visitors than on the first day. 

BitSummit 2019 was officially over.

After that, I took part in the BitSummit Volunteers Wrap-up Dinner. We held the party in a traditional Japanese restaurant. The dinner consisted of a nine-course traditional Japanese cuisine with all-you-can-drink included. Everything was gently paid by the Japan Independent Games Aggregate (JIGA) as a token of gratitude toward all the volunteers. 

The party was amazing.

Unfortunately, I must be at my office early the next day so I couldn’t stay for the after-party. I bid farewell to everybody and I headed toward the Kyoto Station where around midnight I hopped on a nightly bus directed to Tokyo.

Conclusions

Taking part in the BitSummit as a volunteer was an intense and extremely rewarding experience. Getting to know and exchanging thoughts and opinions with other peers in the Japanese game industry was such a pleasure for me. Not to mention that I had the opportunity to finally meet legendary game devs of the caliber of Hideki Kamiya and Hidetaka Suehiro.

See you next year again in Kyoto!

Addendum

Every time I’m in Kyoto I never return home without buying at least 5-6 packs of Yatsuhashi. What are those? You may ask. Originating from Kyoto, Yatsuhashi (also known as Kyoto Triangles) is a Japanese traditional sweet treat. They are made from glutinous rice flour, sugar, and cinnamon. There are two versions available, baked and unbaked (called Nama Yatsuhashi). They are both exquisite. The unbaked ones have a shorter expiration date. Keep that in mind if you’re buying them as souvenirs.
